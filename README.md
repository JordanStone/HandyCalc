HandyCalc

CS338 Personal Project

System Users:
	The target audience of this application will be college age students and others who use calculators often. Although those using math in their classes are the most obvious target, one of the main aims of this calculator is simplifying existing functionality of other calculators so it is more usable to a larger audience. The users of this system would mainly be those frustrated by the archaic existing design of digital calculators due to their reliance on old standbys of physical calculators. Limitations of the users include inexperience with scientific calculators in general or with an interface differing from most popular calculators.  Limitations of the task will require users to have at least some knowledge of how to operate a scientific calculator, although the design of this application hopes to lower that bar.
	
System Specifications:
	The application will on the surface be a scientific calculator, with addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), log, root, and percentage. Other functions may be planned. What will make the application different from other calculators is an interface with more intuitive options for complicated functions. The user will be able to save multiple values to memory, where they will be displayed to the side of the main calculation window. This will include being able save values into memory using CTRL-S like in many other applications or even through click-and-drag. Click-and-drag will also be implemented to bring in a saved value into a calculation. As well, CTRL-Z will undo a calculation while CTRL-Y will redo the last calculation used.


Project Plan

Week 1: Sketch out interface design and improve design based on feedback and evaluation from professor and other students.

Week 2: Design basic calculator functionality in both GUI and programming. This includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equals, and clearing functions. Implement some keyboard shortcuts planned. This includes CTRL-S function to save values to memory and function to access values stored in memory. Implement undo and redo functions here if time permits.

Week 3: Implement further calculation functions not yet created â€“ i.e. trig, root, percentage, and log. Implement click-and-drag functionality for values in memory. Implement any other click-and-drag functions decided upon. Release a prototype to be tested by small control group of users to take note of what to change within final design. Implement undo and redo functions if not done by last week.

Week 4: Implement any functions not implemented yet due to time constraints or design issues. This likely will include click-and-drag functions. Improve graphical design and fix remaining errors or bugs based on input received.
